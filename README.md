## Project Title: Diabetes Data Analysis and Visualization
### Overview:

This project involves the analysis and visualization of a dataset related to diabetes diagnosis. The dataset, originally sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, consists of medical predictor variables and a target dependent variable (Outcome) indicating whether a patient has diabetes. The objective of this project was to gain insights into the dataset, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and create informative visualizations.
### Project Highlights:

- **Data Exploration**: The project began with an in-depth exploration of the dataset, including understanding the variables, data cleaning, and addressing missing values.
- 
- **KPI Identification**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) were identified to measure various aspects of the dataset. KPIs included diabetes rate, average glucose level, age distribution, outcome distribution, pregnancies vs. diabetes rate, and more.
- - **Data Visualization**: Visualizations were created using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These visualizations included bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
  - - **Insightful Findings**: The project revealed valuable insights, such as correlations between variables, age-specific trends in diabetes rates, and distributions of important health parameters like glucose, BMI, and insulin.
    - ### Technologies Used:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ### Future Improvements:

This project can be expanded in the future to include machine learning models for predictive analysis. By building classification models, it would be possible to predict diabetes based on the dataset's features, providing a practical application for healthcare decision-making

### Conclusion:

The Diabetes Data Analysis and Visualization project demonstrates strong data analysis and visualization skills, including data preprocessing, KPI identification, and insightful visualizations. It can serve as an example of data-driven decision-making and exploratory data analysis for potential employers and collaborators.
